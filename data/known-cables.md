# Known cables

A working list of USB-C cables that have been reported to WhatCable via the
in-app "Report this cable" flow. This is a memory aid for future trust-signal
and inventory work, seeded from the closed [`cable-report`](https://github.com/darrylmorley/whatcable/issues?q=label%3Acable-report)
issues on GitHub.

The full reports (with reporter notes, dates, and triage replies) live on the
issue tracker. This file holds a condensed, deduplicated view of the e-marker
fingerprints. Vendor names below come from the bundled USB-IF list (shipped
with WhatCable v0.8.1 onwards), not from whatever name the reporting build
showed at the time.

## Why this file exists

WhatCable's [issue template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/cable-report.yml)
states the goal: a public database of known-good and counterfeit USB-C cable
fingerprints. The Cable Trust Signals work (see `planning/cable-trust-signals.md`)
will eventually consume a curated subset of this. For now it is a flat
hand-maintained markdown table; format may change once the consumer exists.

Sorted by VID. The zeroed-fingerprint entry is parked at the bottom because it
is identity-less.

## Patterns worth flagging for trust-signals work

Patterns the planned Cable Trust Signals heuristics should pick up:

1. **Marketing claim outpaces e-marker capability.** #49 (Dbilida) is sold as
   "Thunderbolt 4 / 40 Gbps / 240 W" but the e-marker reports passive USB4
   Gen 3 with no USB-IF cert. #169 (generic AliExpress TB4 cable) reports
   USB4 Gen 3 TB4 class with no XID despite being sold with TB4 logos on
   both plugs. The cables may carry the advertised data rate, but there is
   no cert backing the claim.
2. **Genuinely unregistered VID with no XID.** #71 (UGOURD AliExpress) and
   #151 (AGFINEST / ULT-unite) both report 80 Gbps USB4 Gen 4 from an
   unregistered VID and zero XID. Plausibly real silicon, but unverifiable
   from the e-marker alone.
3. **Zeroed identity fields.** Now a common pattern across budget and even
   major-brand cables. First seen in #61 (CUKTECH No.6) with no VDO at all,
   then in many cables that report a power-class Cable VDO but zeroed
   VID/PID (#91, #92, #108, #116, #126, #132, #134, #136, #156, #158, #166,
   #170). Worth distinguishing the truly identity-less subset (no VDO at
   all) from the cables that publish power data but not vendor identity.
4. **Shared ODM silicon across brands.** Multiple cables with different
   brand labels report the same VID + Cable VDO, indicating they share
   e-marker silicon from a common ODM. Examples so far: Chengdu
   Convenientpower (`0x315C`) across acasis #45, PX #144, and the
   AliExpress TB4 cable in #169; Shenzhen Injoinic (`0x2E87`) across
   Baseus Pudding 100 W (#167) and CUKTECH PB200N powerbank built-in
   cable (#168). Same silicon, same VDO, different brand labels. Trust
   signals should treat these as one supplier's hardware, not as
   independent vendor diversity.

## Adding new entries

When a new cable-report issue lands and you've triaged + closed it,
the workflow is:

```bash
swift scripts/sync-cable-reports.swift     # pulls rows from gh
swift scripts/render-known-cables.swift    # rebuilds docs/cables.html
```

The sync script reads every closed `cable-report` issue via `gh`, parses
the e-marker fingerprint table, looks up canonical USB-IF vendor names
from the bundled TSV, and rewrites the table block above. Existing rows'
"Brand / model context" cells are preserved by issue number; brand new
rows land with `(needs review)` as a placeholder.

After running the sync:

1. Look at any rows still showing `(needs review)`. Open the source issue,
   read the reporter's "What's the story" notes, and replace the
   placeholder with a one-line phrase covering brand and purchase context.
   Strip Amazon affiliate links, full product titles, and anything that
   reads as personal context.
2. If the report shows a trust-signal pattern (marketing / e-marker
   mismatch, unregistered VID + no cert, zeroed fields, impossible PDOs),
   add a bullet to the Patterns section above.
3. Re-run the renderer if you edited the markdown again.
4. Commit `data/known-cables.md` and `docs/cables.html` together.

If you need to fix a row by hand (say a vendor name TSV entry was wrong
upstream), edit `data/known-cables.md` directly. The sync script will
preserve your edits as long as they live in the "Brand / model context"
column. Other columns get rewritten on next sync, so structural changes
need to land in the script or the underlying issue body.

This file is not bundled into the app. It is a human reference. When the
trust-signals or inventory features need this data at runtime, we'll
formalise it then.
